                <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles (two of those being pony cars) produced by American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.</p>
                <p>From model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.</p>
                <p>The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe version of an economical compact car.</p>
                <p>The third and current generation is a pony car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro.</p>
                <p>Introduced in fall 1969 for the 1970 model year, the Challenger was one of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller Plymouth Barracuda. Positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market segment, it was "a rather late response" to the Ford Mustang, which debuted in April 1964. Even so, Chrysler intended the new Challenger as the most potent pony car ever, and, like the less expensive Barracuda, it was available in a staggering number of trim and option levels, and with virtually every engine in Chrysler's inventory.</p>
                <p>The Challenger's longer wheelbase, larger dimensions, and more luxurious interior were prompted by the launch of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, likewise a bigger, more luxurious and more expensive pony car aimed at affluent young American buyers.[8] The 110 in (2,800 mm) wheelbase was 2 in (51 mm) longer than the Barracuda's, and the Dodge differed substantially in its sheetmetal, much as the Cougar differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air conditioning and a rear window defogger were optional.[9] With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both cars differed from each other in that the Challenger had four headlights and the Barracuda had only two; this is similar to how the 1967–73 Mustangs and Cougars looked, as well as the 1967–69 Camaros and Firebirds.</p>
                <p>Exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966 Dodge Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an older sketch of an unbuilt 1966 Charger prototype that was to have a turbine engine. Although the Challenger was well received by the public (with 76,935 produced for the 1970 model year), it was criticized by the press, and the pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger arrived. Sales fell dramatically after 1970, and though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 Challengers were sold over this generation's lifespan.</p>

            <div class="main" id="dodge"><p>For the 2019 model year, Dodge released new high performance versions of the challenger, trimmed the line-up down to six models, and made numerous other tweaks and changes. The model line-up for 2019 includes the following trims: SXT, GT, R/T, R/T Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye. Both SXT and GT models are now available in both rear and all wheel drive, with the GT previously having been the only model available in AWD. GTs gain a more aggressive look with a performance hood, front splitter, and steering and suspension while maintaining the optional performance handling group which includes wider wheels, performance summer tires, 4-piston Brembo brakes, and fixed-rate Bilstein suspension. The SXT model loses the performance handling group as an option, lacks the more aggressive exterior upgrades of the GT and has less aggressive gearing, making it the cheaper economical alternative. R/T Scat Pack models come with a new power-bulge aluminum hood standard. Plucked from the SRT Hellcat, this hood features dual air extractors that cool the engine and help reduce lift. For 5.7L and 6.4L V8 R/T models, the rear seats can be deleted at the cost of $1 and have a net weight savings of 55 lbs. In addition, a second level of the performance handling group called the "performance plus package" is offered, providing 20-Inch x 9.5-inch low-gloss black forged wheels, 275/40ZR20 Pirelli P Zero summer tires, and a limited slip differential in addition to the upgrades found in the performance handling group which remains unchanged since its introduction in 2018.</p><p><b>SRT Hellcat:</b> A slight increase in power is present for 2019, with horsepower rising to 717 and lb-ft to 656. A new dual snorkel hood is also new. Additionally, the ’19 model’s starting price is more than $5,500 lower compared to the 2018 model. A 6-speed Tremec manual and ZF 8-speed automatic remain the sole transmission options.</p><p><b>SRT Hellcat Redeye:</b> Following the discontinuation of the Demon, the Redeye was created to fill the void. Essentially a heavily upgraded Hellcat, the Redeye is equipped with a slightly less powerful (due to a smaller hood intake system) Demon engine: a supercharged 6.2L V8 producing 797 horsepower and 707 lb-ft of torque, an increase of 90&#160;hp (67&#160;kW) and 11&#160;lb⋅ft (15&#160;N⋅m) over the standard Hellcat motor. Other upgrades include reinforced ZF 8 speed automatic, track-tuned suspension, Torque Reserve and 41-Spline Heavy-Duty Half-Shafts, and SRT Power Chiller and After-Run Chiller.</p><p><b>Scat Pack 1320 Package:</b> Equipped with the venerable 6.4L Chrysler Hemi Engine</a> producing 485&#160;hp (362&#160;kW) and 475&#160;lb⋅ft (644&#160;N⋅m), the Scat Pack 1320 adds 20-Inch x 9.5-Inch Low Gloss Black Drag Wheels, 275/40R20 102W drag radial tires, adaptive damping suspension, SRT-tuned drag suspension, air catcher headlamps, deletion of front and rear passenger seats, a special speed limited engine controller, extreme-duty 41-spline half shafts and a trans-brake. Specially developed Nexen 275/40R20l street-legal drag radial tires are available for better grip.</p><p>The Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack 1320 can be modified for NHRA competition in accordance with Stock and Super Stock class rules. It will feature a class weight break of 8.72 and carry a minimum weight of 3,400 pounds. Contestants intending to compete at an NHRA event must meet all regulations for the category entered.</p><p><b>Widebody Package:</b> For 2019, buyers will be able to order their Challenger Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye with the "Widebody Package". When purchased, the challenger gains the following:</p>
                <ul><li>Widebody fender flares</li>
                    <li>20x11 Devils Rim forged aluminum wheels</li>
                    <li>305/35ZR20 Pirelli 3-season performance tires</li>
                    <li>3-mode Bilstein adaptive damping suspension uniquely tuned for competition use</li>
                    <li>6-piston calipers with 15.4 inch vented and slotted rotors in the front (standard on Hellcat and hellcat Redeye models)</li>
                    <li>Stiffened anti-roll bars sized 34mm in front and 22mm rear (standard on Hellcat and hellcat Redeye models)</li></ul>
